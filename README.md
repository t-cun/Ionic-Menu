# Ionic-Menu
This project was created as part of a AngularJS [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hybrid-mobile-development) with Ionic
provided through Coursera. This project is a follow-up to a previous [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/angular-js) (Repository
available [here](https://github.com/tcunningham07/AngularJS-Menu)).
This repository contains code progress over the course of the material provided via video lectures and coding assignments.
Additonally, the project has been remasked as well as additional features added, including firebase integration. Other tools that have
used as part of the project include bower and npm. The app is currently downloadable on the Google Play store as [Spice Shack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.spiceshackionic256949).

My intention is use this project as a resource for current and future students of the course and as an example project for anyone learning
AngularJS. As part of my front-end development study I have also completed the next course in coursera's Full Stack Specialization, and have
another repository available for the completed project [here](https://github.com/tcunningham07/Ionic-Menu). This course covers hybrid
mobile-app development using AngularJS and the Ionic Framework.

## Usage

### Clone the repository

Clone the repository on your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/tcunningham07/Ionic-Menu.git
```

Install the required tools: `cordova`, `ionic`:
```
npm install -g cordova ionic
```

Additionally, if you did not install `gulp` and `bower` from the previous course or have not installed them before:
```
npm install -g gulp bower
```

Once the dependencies have installed, preview the project:
```
ionic serve
```

*This README is currently under development, please check back soon.*
